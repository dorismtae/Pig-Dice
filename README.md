## Description
This is pig-dice game. This is how the game is played. There are two players, the first player rolls the dice to his satisfaction and is awarded points according to each roll. The second player also rolls the dice to his satisfaction and is awarded according to each roll. The caution is, if any of the player roll the dice and the dice falls on number 1 then all the points he is awarded will be deducted to zero. If a player feels  he is satisfied with rolling of the dice then he holds and let's another player roll the dice.
